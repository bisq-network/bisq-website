Asset listing fees were 1 BSQ per day, and upon DAO approval, this proposal increased them to 10 BSQ per day.

Rationale: although adding new altcoins is currently on hold, the 1 BSQ per day fee to list new altcoins is so low that it becomes a cheap PR opportunity for altcoin marketers to show off how many exchanges their altcoin is listed on.

Increasing the fee better values the MoneyNull network and increases the barrier to be listed to a more reasonable but manageable level.
