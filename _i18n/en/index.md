# Welcome to Bisq!
Bisq is an open-source desktop application that allows you to buy and sell bitcoins in exchange for national currencies, or alternative crypto currencies.

## How to get started

Bisq is unique in that it enables you to start trading in less than 10 minutes:

 1. [Download the app](/downloads/), or build it from source.
 2. Add your national or crypto currency accounts.
 3. Create new offer or take an existing one.
 4. Follow the user interface to finalize the trade.

## Features and Philosophy

Unlike traditional online exchanges, Bisq is designed to be:

 - **Instantly accessible** – no need for registration or approval from a central authority.
 - **Decentralized** – there is no single point of failure. The system is peer-to-peer and trading can not be stopped or censored.
 - **Safe** – Bisq never holds your funds. Decentralized arbitration system and security deposits protect traders.
 - **Private** – no one except trading partners exchange personally identifying data. All personal data is stored locally.
 - **Secure** – end-to-end encrypted communication routed over Tor.
 - **Open** – every aspect of the project is transparent. The code is [open source](https://github.com/bisq-network/exchange).
 - **Easy** – we take usability seriously.

Bisq is for those who do not want to forfeit control or privacy to a central authority in order to trade with other individuals. We regard financial transactions as a form of private speech that should be protected from surveillance by banks, governments, and other institutions.
