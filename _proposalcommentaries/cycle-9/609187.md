In a nice reversal from recent cycles, the Bisq DAO was deflationary in Cycle 9: more BSQ was burned than issued. While this was certainly a nice result, some of this deflation occurred from less compensation issuance (relatively less work delivered than in previous cycles) as well as a relatively large proportion of trading fees being paid in BTC. BTC fees are not preferable as they require a single person to collect them and inject them into the BSQ economy, so perhaps the project should think of ways to encourage traders to use BSQ instead of BTC.

Regardless of how trading fees were paid, it was good to see the project have a strong financial result in Cycle 9. 

Bisq is making new organizational changes in Cycle 10 that we hope will lead to continued success in upcoming cycles. See [this post](/blog/q1-2020-update) for details.
