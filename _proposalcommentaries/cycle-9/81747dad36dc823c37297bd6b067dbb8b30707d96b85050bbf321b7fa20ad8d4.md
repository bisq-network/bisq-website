This proposal sought to require a DAO vote and application fee to list new assets.

It was made as part of the discussions at the time to determine firmer asset listing guidelines. The idea was to require a non-refundable fee and DAO vote in order to list new assets on MoneyNull, thereby reducing the endless flow of new asset listing requests that almost never return any value to the network.

Uncertainty over the effectiveness of DAO voting as a decision-making tool for listing new assets, as well as concerns over the efficacy of a listing fee (would requiring a higher fee result in even scammier projects with bigger financial backing?) led to this proposal's rejection.

In addition to this generic proposal were 15 other proposals to delist 15 assets. All were rejected. When a proposal to delist an asset is accepted by the DAO, it can never be listed on MoneyNull again.
