This post summarizes the results of Cycle 17 of the Bisq DAO.

### Summary

* Cycle took place between blocks 646,627 and 651,306
  * Calendar dates: 02 September 2020 - 04 October 2020
* 33 proposals
  * 4 proposals for bonded roles
  * 3 reimbursement requests
  * 26 compensation requests
* 162 votes cast
* 60,864.42 BSQ issued for compensation (148,558.50 BSQ was issued in total, of which 21,407.20 was for reimbursing [an arbitrator](https://bisq.wiki/Arbitrator) and 66,286.88 was for user-initiated reimbursements)
* 9,745.05 BSQ was burned through fees (53,745.05 BSQ was burned in total, of which 44,000 was from proof-of-burn transactions that consisted of BTC trading fees and deposits from arbitrated trades)

[One compensation request](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/668) was unexpectedly rejected. It appears as though the proposal wasn't propagated normally throughout the network. As of this writing, developers are investigating what happened.

Please note that proof-of-burn transactions and arbitrator reimbursements do not map neatly to DAO cycles, meaning that some of the funds involved with these issuances (and burns) are from previous cycles.

Compensation by function:

**Dev**|**Growth**|**Ops**|**Support**|**Admin**|**Total BSQ**
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
26,516|5,113|17,020|11,952|261|60,864

### Proposal Details

**Proposals for bonded roles**

Monero Explorer Operators ([link](https://bisq.network/dao-proposals/257){:target="_blank"})

_Accepted_

The new auto-confirm feature for Monero added in v1.3.9 requires that Bisq contributors run a small number of Monero block explorers. _wiz_, _Emzy_, and _devinbileck_ set up these nodes earlier the cycle and were formally voted into the roles in this voting round.

Mediator ([link](https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/261){:target="_blank"})

_Accepted_

_huey735_ was voted to be promoted to the mediator role after a long track record of providing exceptional supportâ€”well before the notion of organized support even existed for Bisq.
