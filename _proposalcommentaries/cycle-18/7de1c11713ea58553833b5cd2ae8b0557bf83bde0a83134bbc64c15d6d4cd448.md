This proposal establishes a new method for determining the BSQ-USD rate. 

Instead of using a simple average, the compensation maintainer makes a proposal with a rate he thinks is better by removing outliers. If the rate is generally accepted by stakeholders, it takes effect for all requests in the next cycle. If not, multiple rate proposals can be submitted for DAO voting, and the rate that garners the most voting weight wins and takes effect in the next cycle.

A better-defined process is needed, because lately there have been a number of outlier BSQ trades that made the simple average impractical to use and generally vulnerable to manipulation. 

Since the BSQ issuance rate was unpegged from the US dollar [back in Cycle 6](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/proposals/issues/114){:target="blank"}, the simple volume-weighted 90-day average BSQ-USD rate has been used to determine the rate for DAO issuance requests (compensation and reimbursements).
