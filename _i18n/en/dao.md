# The Bisq DAO

Decentralized autonomous organization

Very contrary to the infamous ICO models where people ask for a lot of money for whitepaper-ware we have a working platform developed by altruistic contributions and donations which is out since more than a year and we will distribute the ownership and management to those who have contributed to the project - those who helped to make a decentralized exchange reality!

The paper about the Bisq DAO:

 - [Bisq DAO - Overview](/docs/dao/overview)
 - [Bisq DAO - More details and technical specification](/docs/dao/specification)
 - [Bisq arbitration and mediation system](/docs/exchange/arbitration-system)

As soon the DAO has launched the DAO tokens (BSQ) can be traded like any other crypto currency in Bisq.

We distribute the tokens to many contributors who have supported us.
