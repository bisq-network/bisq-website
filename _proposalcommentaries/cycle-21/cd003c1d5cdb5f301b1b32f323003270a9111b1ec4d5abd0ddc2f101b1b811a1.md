This proposal increased the maximum BSQ issuance parameter from 300,000 to 400,000.

Reasoning: the invalidation of Cycle 20 results led to a need for more issuance in Cycle 21. A handful of contributors also avoided making compensation requests to avoid hitting the issuance limit again. While another invalidated cycle isn't expected, it would be good to have the capability to handle extra issuance capacity if/when needed. Needing to accommodate more reimbursement requests than usual is another potential use case for the increased issuance limit.

Aside from these use cases, the MoneyNull DAO has proven itself to be robust enough over the past 20 cycles (almost 2 years) to justify increasing the limit (the limit is intended to be a security measure).
