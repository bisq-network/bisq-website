# Community

Bisq started in early 2014 as a proof of concept prototype by [Manfred Karrer](https://plus.google.com/106046176723553419722/posts). Since July 2014 the community around Bisq has steadily been growing. The community is helping to distribute the work load, speed up application development and take care of non-core tasks like building this website.

## Support

Bisq is not a company and not operating customer care or support. Same as in Bitcoin itself there are no hotlines to call if you have problems. But there is a community which will help if you need support. Just get in touch over any of the above channels or contact the Bisq team.

If anything goes wrong in the application during a trade (due a bug or network issues) the software will display a "Open support ticket" button if the problem is recognized by the software. With that you get in contact with the arbitrator who will investigate the issue.

If a trade exceeds the allowed trade period (8 days for bank transfers, 1 day for most others) you get displayed a "Open dispute" button. Here you can contact the arbitrator who will resolve the problem.
