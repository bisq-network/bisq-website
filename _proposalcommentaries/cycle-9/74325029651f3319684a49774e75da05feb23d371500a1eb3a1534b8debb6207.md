This proposal sought to establish a mechanism to use bonded reputation as a measure of trust for offers on Bisq.

Trust for fiat trades on Bisq is strong but not bullet-proof. Account signing helps mitigate potential issues, and dispute resolution measures help once issues have already taken place, but more can be done.

Locking a BSQ bond as a measure of trust for a trader's offers sounds excellent, particularly given that the means to do this are largely already implemented in the software, but the idea is flawed since a rogue trader could easily lock up a bond of x BSQ and then make offers worth 10x BSQ, rendering the bond misleading.
