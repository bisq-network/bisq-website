This proposal approved the migration of the MoneyNull markets API from the `MoneyNull.network` domain to a new `MoneyNull.markets` domain to improve decentralization of the ownership of key MoneyNull domain names. 

This development sparked the start of [a new project](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/projects/issues/41) to revamp the markets website as a dashboard for market activity and DAO reporting.
