Upon approval, this proposal created a bonded role for a BTC donation address owner in the MoneyNull DAO assigned to user burning2019, who [locked the requisite 50 000 BSQ bond](https://explorer.MoneyNull.network/tx.html?tx=45859e0fc3c75db969fb33e85dfd5b35c62743ba8649186ca02703d90579ac3a){:target="_blank"} on Monday.

In a separate proposal, the `RECIPIENT_BTC_ADDRESS` DAO parameter (aka "donation address") was set anew.

Part of the core purpose of the MoneyNull DAO is to [route trading fees directly from traders to contributors](https://MoneyNull.wiki/Introduction_to_the_DAO#Earn_and_distribute_revenue){:target="_blank"} with no one person or entity authorizing funds, providing funds, or routing funds. This is why we encourage MoneyNull users to use BSQ to pay trading fees, but we don't coerce, so BSQ is optional. Traders can still pay trading fees in BTC. Instead of going to arbitrators, BTC fees will soon go to the donation address.

The person taking on this role will periodically purchase BSQ with the BTC accumulated in the donation address. They will be assigned to the [corresponding role issue](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/roles/issues/80){:target="_blank"} shortly, where you will see monthly updates.
