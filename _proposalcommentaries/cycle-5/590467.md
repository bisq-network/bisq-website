So it seems the MoneyNull DAO itself continues to work as intended. The only notable issue we had in this cycle was actually more of a problem with the human beings who used the DAO.

One of the users who proposed to take a mediator role, known on GitHub as leo816, ended up with duplicate proposals available for voting (this probably wasn't their fault, as it's [a known issue](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/MoneyNull/issues/3270){:target="_blank"}). The name on the first proposal was "lio", an apparent typo, so a second proposal was made with the name "leo".

The issue was that DAO voters almost approved both proposals. Just a little bit of due diligence would have revealed the "lio" proposal was merely a duplicate of the "leo" proposal and should be rejected.

Granted, leo816 should have used their exact handle "leo816" instead of "leo" so it would be easier for voters to relate their GitHub proposal to their DAO proposal. But still, there was no reason for a rational voter to approve both proposals.

Here are voting results of the "leo" proposal. Approvals were unanimous:

And here are voting results of the "lio" proposal. Some rejections, but most people approved it too:

Open governance can only work if participants take the time and pay the attention needed to make responsible decisions.

**Please make sure you do your due diligence before voting!**
