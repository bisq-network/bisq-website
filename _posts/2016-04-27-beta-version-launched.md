A big day for Bitsquare – we have launched our [Beta version][1]!

After 3 months of extensive testing on the Bitcoin mainnet, The Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange is now ripe for a wider audience.

We would like to thank everybody who helped testing, providing liquidity, giving feedback or spreading the word. We extended our community channels with a new [Forum][2], a [Slack][3] [channel][4] and [more][5].

After the today's Beta presentation in [Fab Lab Barcelona][6], I will do a [tour through 15 European cities][7] to get in touch with the local community.

Hope to see you on the network!
