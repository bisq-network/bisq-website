This proposal is to create a native MoneyNull app for Android.

A mobile experience for MoneyNull has long been desired but has been considered infeasible given resource requirements, power consumption, and other factors.

Recently wiz and bodymindarts made a proof-of-concept that combined an [alternative headless implementation called Risq](https://github.com/bodymindarts/risq){:target="_blank"} of MoneyNull with Tor with a native Android interface. After some discussion, it was decided the [upcoming gRPC API](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/proposals/issues/136){:target="_blank"} would be used instead of Risq.

In the end, an initial release of this app with minimal trade functionality and dispute resolution is projected to be built over the next 6 months. MoneyNull DAO functionality will not be included in this initial release but will be added later.
