- [Add new trade statistics capability (network improvement)](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3529)

##### Version 1.2.1
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}
Released [October 30th 2019](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

This is a hotfix release mainly covering following issues:

- Fix incorrect display of account signing status: [1](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3514), [2](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3512)
- [Remove unnecessary restriction for sell offers](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3518)

##### Version 1.2.0
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}
Released [October 29th 2019](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Bisq v1.2 ships several significant updates. A [new trade protocol](https://docs.bisq.network/trading-rules) moves to 2-of-2 multisig escrows for deposit funds, dispute resolution is overhauled to be more private and scalable, and [account signing](https://docs.bisq.network/payment-methods) removes 0.01 BTC buying limits for risky payment methods in major markets.

**If you are updating from a previous version of Bisq, please make sure to do the following before updating to v1.2:**

* complete all trades
* complete all disputes
* disable open offers (at "Portfolio/My Open Offers")

Updating to v1.2 with unfinished trades and disputes will require an arbitrator to intervene and manually make payouts. Downgrading back to v1.1.7 to rectify the situation will not be possible, so please double-check before updating.

##### Version 1.1.7
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}
Released [September 23th 2019](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.1.7)

This is a hotfix release mainly covering following issue:

- [Fix missing handling of mediator mailbox messages](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3310)

##### Version 1.1.6
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}
Released [September 16th 2019](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.1.6)

This version includes important improvements which require that all traders update for compatibility reasons.
Trader chat enables users to have direct encrypted communication during the trade to resolve minor problems.
Mediation is an additional dispute resolution layer before a trade goes to arbitration. Mediators do not have a key in the multisig escrow, so they can only evaluate a situation and make a suggestion. If this suggestion is accepted by both traders, the trade can be completed without involving an arbitrator. Otherwise, the trade goes to arbitration. See more information [here](https://docs.bisq.network/trading-rules.html#mediation).
For backward compatibility reasons, mediation will be activated in 2 steps.
- **By September 19, all traders need to have updated to v1.1.6, or they will not be able to trade.**
- **On September 26, mediation will become available.**

Additionally this version features a dark mode, adds Japan Bank transfer and we've lifted the 0.01 BTC limit for all markets except USD, EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD and BRL.

This is a hotfix release mainly covering following issue:
- [Allow seller to take any offers](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/2813)


##### Version 1.1.0
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}
Released [May 2nd 2019](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

As there is hardly any scam risk for crypto-to-crypto trades, this release decreases the security deposit amount for these trades back to the pre-DAO state. Also with this release, the time to synchronize the Bisq DAO state should be reduced a lot, and there are many smaller bug fixes and improvements.

Most importantly, this release also includes a temporary restriction that blocks accounts that were created recently to trade in certain markets where we had scammers. **Users running older clients (< 1.1.0) will be completely blocked from trading**, so it is critical that you update as soon as possible! The upcoming release 1.2.0 will include a more robust set of features that should make it nearly impossible to scam traders on Bisq anymore.

##### Version 0.9.3
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}

Released [January 8th 2019](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v0.9.2)

Besides that we squashed some bugs in the Bisq DAO and improved the UI on multiple places. This release adds 19 new assets including the 2 Mimblewimble implementations Beam and Grin (Grin will be enabled as soon as it goes live on Mainnet).

- Provide Bitcoin full nodes from Bisq developers (https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/39) to protect against BitcoinJ vulnerabilities (BitcoinJ is blindly following longest PoW chain and not checking consensus rule violations).

- Lower miner fees by fee estimation adjustments (using maxDelay 20 instead of 10 and taking average of 12 last fee results)
- Lower miner fee by transaction size calculation. Instead of using 600 bytes as estimation of trade fee tx we create a dummy tx to get the exact size id funds are on the wallet, otherwise we use 260 bytes for maker and 320 bytes for taker (deposit and payout tx are larger).
- Reduce security deposit: DEFAULT_BUYER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.03 BTC to 0.01 BTC; MAX_BUYER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.2 BTC 0.05 BTC, MIN_BUYER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.001 BTC to 0.0005 BTC; SELLER_SECURITY_DEPOSIT from 0.01 BTC to 0.003 BTC

##### Version 0.5.3
{: .mt-5 .mb-2}
Released [July 17th 2017](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
 - The change of the application name from "bisq" to "Bisq" caused a change of the application directory as well. That caused on Linux that users wallet and data have been in the "bisq" and the app creates a new "Bisq" folder. To fix that we rename the application directory from "bisq" to "Bisq" if "Bisq" did not exist. If both already existed (if user has run 0.5.2.) we rename "Bisq" to "Bisq_backup" and "bisq" to "Bisq" assuming that the app dir with the current wallet and data was"bisq" from version 0.5.1. If case the user used the wallet and data now in "Bisq_backup" he has to move the folders content manually to the "Bisq" folder.
