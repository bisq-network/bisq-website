This proposal was made to increase the maximum trade limit for new accounts to 0.02 BTC from 0.01 BTC. The limit was placed on new payment accounts created after March 01 2019 as a temporary measure against stolen bank account scammers while protection mechanisms are conceived and implemented. 

Although DAO voting approved this proposal, the change was not ultimately implemented, presumably because of [concerns over backward compatibility](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/MoneyNull/pull/2904).

This outcome highlights an important distinction between DAO proposal types: proposals to change DAO parameters go into effect immediately upon approval (e.g., trading fees). Other proposals, like this 0.02 trade size increase request, require developers to manually make changes, which means there's a chance an approved measure might not actually make it into the software. Of course, there are incentives to discourage developers from defying DAO vote results (e.g., voters could reject a rogue developer's compensation requests, discouraging them from continuing to contribute altogether) but it's interesting to note the dynamic. Even though it's called a decentralized _autonomous_ organization, humans can still be responsible for imposing the will of the DAO's stakeholders.
