This parameter change increased the maximum reimbursement amount from 20,000 to 40,000. 

The goal is to increase this parameter to 100,000 over the next 2 cycles (it cannot be increased to 100,000 at once because the maximum single change allowed for this parameters is 200%).

Before Cycle 12, the upper limit for a compensation request was 100,000 BSQ while the upper limit for a reimbursement request was only 10,000 BSQ. As a result, because the arbitrator's reimbursement requests would often be rather large, they had to make compensation requests instead of reimbursement requests.
