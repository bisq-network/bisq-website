There were some issues with seed nodes that sometimes caused the DAO state to go out of sync on certain MoneyNull nodes. These issues surfaced in this cycle when a contributor made a compensation request, deleted it, and then made another oneâ€”but both requests remained available for voting. The situation was clarified on GitHub, so stakeholders knew to reject the old proposal and approve the new one. The underlying issue on the network's seed nodes has already been fixed. Vote results and BSQ issued were not affected.

Fee increases from the previous cycle, despite fees still being below targets, resulted in the first-ever deflationary period for the BSQ colored coin. Of course, development efforts were depressed in this period, so issuance was relatively low, but it was still nice to see.
