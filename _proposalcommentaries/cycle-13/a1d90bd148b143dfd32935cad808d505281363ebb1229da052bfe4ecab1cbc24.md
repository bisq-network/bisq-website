As a result of the <a href="https://bisq.network/statement-security-vulnerability-april-2020">April security vulnerability</a>, this proposal seeks to establish a new security team as a core project function to handle auditing, responsible disclosures, bounties, and more, to make sure such an incident doesn't happen again.
