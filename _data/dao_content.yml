- title: Why?
  intro: "
          <p>Bisq trading is currently decentralized, but its revenue distribution and decision-making are not.</p>
          <p>It is critical that Bisq be resistant to censorship, and the trade protocol and P2P network achieve this—for traders.</p>
          <p>What about Bisq's developers? Project decision-making and revenue distribution are still centralized, and this creates vulnerabilities.</p>

- title: What Is The Bisq DAO?
  intro: "
          <p>The Bisq DAO enables value transfer from traders to contributors. The BSQ token makes this possible in a decentralized way.</p>
          <p>Trading fees are distributed to contributors without the confines of a corporation or other legal entity, keeping Bisq stateless & sovereign.</p>

- title: How Does It Work?
  intro: "
          <div class=\"subtitle pt-4\">
            Revenue distribution
          </div>

          <div class=\"small\">
            <p>
              To distribute revenue from trading fees to contributors, Bisq uses BSQ - a Bitcoin-based colored coin. Contributors are issued new BSQ when stakeholders approve their compensation requests through voting, and BSQ gets “uncolored” when traders use it to pay trading fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no central entity collecting or creating BSQ—Bisq stakeholders are collectively in charge of the issuance process.
            </p>
            <p class=\"disclaimer\">
              This is not an ICO. No BSQ is sold to raise capital.
            </p>
          </div>


          <div class=\"subtitle pt-3\">
            Decision-making
          </div>

          <div class=\"small\">
            <p>
              With no CEO or central leadership team, Bisq stakeholders—traders and contributors—are the owners of Bisq.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through social consensus (via voting) they determine Bisq's project strategy.
            </p>

          </div>
