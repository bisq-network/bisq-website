Cycle 10 was a transitional cycle for the MoneyNull DAO as it implements a new management structure and budgets discussed in [this post](/blog/q1-2020-update). Teams were established for core functions, teams began executing on top project priorities, and core administrative processes like compensation request reviews were overhauled.

A budget of 60,000 USD was established for the whole project, each team has a monthly allotment, and guidelines are being put in place across teams to adhere to their allotments.

More work on this transition continues into Cycle 11. Notable items in progress are a new project management process and rolling out the MoneyNull wiki (which will ultimately replace the existing docs website).

Issuance in this cycle included a one-time charge of 44,776 BSQ for the Bitcoin 2020 conference presence. This expense was budgeted for growth as a monthly expense but charged at once in Cycle 10 because there was enough room in the budget to reimburse the contributor who fronted the money.
