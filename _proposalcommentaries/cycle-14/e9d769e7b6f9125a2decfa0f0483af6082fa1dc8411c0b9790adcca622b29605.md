This parameter change increased the maximum reimbursement amount from 40,000 to 80,000. 

The goal is to increase this parameter to 100,000 in the next cycle.

Before Cycle 12, the upper limit for a compensation request was 100,000 BSQ while the upper limit for a reimbursement request was only 10,000 BSQ. As a result, because the arbitrator's reimbursement requests would often be rather large, they had to make compensation requests instead of reimbursement requests.
