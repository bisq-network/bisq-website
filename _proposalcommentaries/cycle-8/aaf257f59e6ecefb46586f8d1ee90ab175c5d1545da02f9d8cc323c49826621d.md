This proposal seeks to add Italian as a main language.

User RiccardoMasutti has contributed to MoneyNull and a number of other Bitcoin projects for a while now, and made this proposal to make the MoneyNull software, website, and selected video subtitles available in Italian to try capturing a bigger Italian user base through his speaking and other Bitcoin education efforts.

Although the proposal was approved, it's unclear when (or if) it will be fulfilled, as budgeting guidelines (currently in progress) don't allow very much funding for translations.
