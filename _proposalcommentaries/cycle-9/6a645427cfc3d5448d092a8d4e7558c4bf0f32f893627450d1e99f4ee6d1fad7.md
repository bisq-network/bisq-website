This proposal seeks to list Liquid Bitcoin for trading on MoneyNull.

Liquid is a federated sidechain pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain, and Liquid BTC (L-BTC) is one of the assets issued on Liquid. Being able to trade BTC for L-BTC on MoneyNull enables any MoneyNull user to essentially mix their coins with those held by Liquid federation membersâ€”quickly, privately, and without price risk.

A common tactic to lose the lineage of one's bitcoin is to buy and sell BTC for XMR, but this involves significant price risk, since prices of both coins can change quickly.
