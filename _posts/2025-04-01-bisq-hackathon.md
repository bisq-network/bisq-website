Bisq is launching its first-ever Hackathon from April 10–13—an open, collaborative space for innovative developers passionate about privacy and decentralization to connect, build, and help shape the future of Bisq.

### Why Are We Launching a Hackathon?

Bisq is looking for experienced, self-driven developers to take on the ambitious challenges outlined in our [roadmap](/blog/bisq-2-now-in-beta/).

This hackathon is a unique opportunity to attract top talent—innovative minds passionate about decentralization, privacy, and building resilient peer-to-peer systems.

With its open-ended format, the event encourages creativity, welcomes fresh ideas, and leaves room for unexpected breakthroughs that could shape Bisq’s future.

### Challenges & Ideas

We’ve outlined key topics below—ranked by priority—but you’re also welcome to propose your own project.

##### [Fee Payment in the MuSig Trade Protocol](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/3345)
- **Problem:** How can we handle trade fees without compromising the privacy gains of the MuSig protocol?
- **Need:** A privacy-preserving, scalable, and decentralization-compatible solution.
- **Status:** We’re actively exploring options but haven’t found the sweet spot yet.

##### [I2P Integration](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/3339)
- **Problem:** I2P was integrated early on but dropped due to lack of development resources.
- **Need:** A developer experienced with I2P to complete its integration into Bisq’s network stack.
- **Goal:** Strengthen network-level resilience and censorship resistance.

##### [Decentralized Reputation System](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/3341)
- **Problem:** Building a reputation system that’s privacy-preserving and decentralized is a hard problem.
- **Need:** Creative solutions leveraging Bisq’s architecture and features.
- **Challenge:** Balancing privacy, decentralization, and usability.


##### [Lightning Network Trade Protocol](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/3342)
- **Problem:** We have a feasible Fiat-LN protocol concept—but it’s complex and infrastructure-heavy.
- **Need:** Simpler, more elegant protocol designs.
- **Status:** Early concept phase—open to new ideas and refinements.


##### [AI Integration in Bisq](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/3344)
- **Current Use:** AI-powered translations are live. An AI support agent is in development but not yet deployed.
- **Need:** Identify new use cases that enhance user experience or enable novel solutions for reputation and security.
- **Goal:** Deliver meaningful, privacy-respecting AI tools aligned with Bisq’s core values.


##### [Scaling the DAO and BSQ](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/discussions/3343)
- **Observation:** After 6 years of DAO activity, data accumulation is impacting performance.
- **Need:** Optimize data storage, access, and processing—especially through APIs for Bisq 2. *(Note: DAO code lives in the Bisq 1 codebase.)*
- **Opportunity:** Improve long-term scalability and simplify integration with Bisq 2.

### Where?

- Bisq Matrix: [https://matrix.to/#/#bisq:bitcoin.kyoto](https://matrix.to/#/#bisq:bitcoin.kyoto)
- Channel: **#bisq-hackathon:matrix.org**

---

### How It Works

##### 1. Preparation
Review the challenge list and get familiar with Bisq.
Setting up a dev environment is recommended—even for conceptual projects.

##### 2. Kickoff
Join the Matrix channel and share your chosen idea or project.
Collaboration is encouraged—join a team or form one!

##### 3. Wrap-Up
Share your progress in the channel by the end of Day 3.
Incomplete projects are welcome—what matters is contribution and momentum.
You're free to continue post-hackathon—just give a quick status update so we can track feedback and next steps.

##### 4. Continue contributing to Bisq
If your work gains traction, you’re welcome to keep building and submit follow-up compensation requests or DAO proposals.

---

### Compensation

Participants can submit a compensation request to the Bisq DAO, self-assessing the value of their work in BSQ. The DAO reviews each request based on its merit, impact, and alignment with Bisq’s goals.

_A high-value contribution may earn up to 2800 BSQ (~$5,000 USD), pending DAO approval._

_See previous contributor [compensation requests](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for more context._
