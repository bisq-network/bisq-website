This somewhat contentious proposal to more tightly integrate Monero with MoneyNull garnered only 5 votes from the 13 ballots cast in this cycle, and 98.85% of the voting weight of those 5 votes opposed the proposal (proposals need less than 49.99% of opposing voting weight to be approved).

The proposal raised larger questions about conventions to integrate relatively large, experimental, and perhaps risky components into the code base. An [incubator space](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/proposals/issues/122){:target="_blank"} was proposed but is now being reconsidered. Several contributors have suggested opening a dialogue on the subject after the launch of v1.2.
