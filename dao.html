        <h3>Why a DAO?</h3>
        <h4>Bisq seems to work just fine right now...?</h4>

        <div class='panel-interlude'>
            <p>Bisq trading is currently decentralized, but management is not.</p>
            <p>Bisq needs to <span class='strong'>decentralize its own management</span> to become truly resistant to censorship.</p>

        <h3>Okay...But Why a Token?</h3>
        <h4>"Just use plain bitcoin"</h4>

        <div class='panel-interlude'>
            <p>To make a Bitcoin transaction, you need a recipient's address. As Bisq itself is decentralized, that address won't be known.</p>
            <p>Thus sending trading fees with a <span class='strong'>plain Bitcoin transaction is impossible</span>, and a token is needed as a placeholder.</p>

        <h3>Common Questions</h3>
        <h4>Let's break it down</h4>

        <div class='faqs'>
            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Is Bisq doing this because it needs money?</p>
                <p>No. Bisq has bootstrapped itself to facilitate 20,000+ total trades since in the 2.5 years since April 2016. It makes real revenue <span class='emphasis'>right now</span>.</p>
                <p>The goal is to remove central points of authority from Bisq's governance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>All tokens are useless. So why create one?</p>
                <p>Tokens so far are useless because they're all issued by legal entities like companies and foundations. These entities could easily accomplish their goals without tokens.</p>
                <p>However, when there is no entity, as in Bisq's case, things change. New tools are needed to collect revenue and make policy. Where can revenue be collected if there is no central wallet? Who determines policy if there is no leadership team?</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Explain to this to me, simply. Please.</p>
                <p>Developer does $1000 of work on Bisq software. He requests $1000 of BSQ, and includes 1000 satoshis with his request. DAO stakeholders vote to approve his request, coloring his 1000 satoshis into BSQ worth $1000. Traders buy this BSQ with $1000 of BTC and redeem the BSQ as trading fees.</p>
                <p>BSQ is just a placeholder for a BTC payment until the other party is known. The DAO is just a mechanism for collective decision-making in the absence of a CEO.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Why can't you just do this with plain Bitcoin?</p>
                <p>Because the sender of bitcoin is not known ahead of time. Consider the trading fee transaction. You need a sender and a recipient to do a Bitcoin transaction, right? There's a gap between the time a contributor does work and the time a trader places a trade, and nowhere to hold the value to be transferred in the interim. BSQ is a tool to hold the value of a contributor's labor until a trader shows up to pay for it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Practically, what changes for me as a user?</p>
                <p>Not much. Old model: pay bitcoin as trading fees. New model: pay bitcoin for BSQ, and redeem BSQ as trading fees. Just 1 extra step.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Even 1 extra step is more work. Why would I do that?</p>
                <p>BSQ trading fees will be dramatically cheaper than plain BTC trading fees. Also, BSQ fees actually help sustain the project and BTC fees do not.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Will I be required to use BSQ to trade on Bisq?</p>
                <p>No, you can choose to continue paying trading fees with plain bitcoin instead of BSQ—just note that (1) you'll pay more and (2) your bitcoin won't go to Bisq contributors, and thus won't help to sustain the project.</p>
                <p>Where exactly BTC trading fees will go has not been decided yet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>But...Bisq works just fine without a token right now. Why do a token?</p>
                <p>Because Bisq is changing its governance model. It's going from a centralized control structure (funding and policy determined by founders) to a decentralized control structure (funding and policy collectively by users and contibutors).</p>
                <p>With the old model, all fees went to the founders. The new model enables fees to be distributed meritocratically to all contributors, and a token is needed to make it work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Why is Bisq changing its governance model?</p>
                <p>Because decentralized software is not good enough. What's the point if the team in charge of the software is still a single point of failure?</p>
                <p>This is why we call it the Bisq Network and not the Bisq Project. This has been the plan from the beginning.</p>
            </div>


            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>The BSQ token bothers me because it creates money out of thin air. That's sketchy.</p>
                <p>The very act of human labor is creating something out of nothing. Take a developer, for instance. When they implement a feature, they'll add code where there wasn't any before. If they do it right, the code they added will result in new functionality. Voilà! They've just created something out of nothing.</p>
                <p>The BSQ token is a tool to capture this newly-created value in an exchangeable medium. Bitcoin miners create money out of thin air too, right? This is no different, just with human labor and validation instead of machine labor and validation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>What is the issuance schedule for BSQ tokens?</p>
                <p>New BSQ is issued every time a contributor's request is approved. BSQ issuance is not a 1-time event. Issuance is not a capital raise like an ICO—it's a revenue event—so it happens continually.</p>
                <p>BSQ is also burned out of existance continually as traders redeem them for trading fees.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='question-answer-group'>
                <p class='question'>Many tokens sound good in theory. How do you know yours will work in practice?</p>
                <p>Good question. Theory cannot be tested until it's put into practice. However, quite a few aspects of the token and DAO have already been put into practice. People have been paying real trading fees to use Bisq for over 2.5 years now, so the token must have value at launch. As for the DAO, the Bisq contributor team has approximated DAO functions with low-tech tools like GitHub and Google Sheets for several months. The DAO merely formalizes these processes.</p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class='panel-interlude'>
            <p>The Bisq DAO and BSQ token are not required to provide Bisq's core trading service today.</p>
            <p>But they are required to <span class='strong'>remove single points of failure from its control structure</span>, so it can be relied upon tomorrow.</p>
