This Roadmap might change at any time, especially in response to [Community](/community/) feedback.

## Planned milestones

### Version 1.0
 - Fully decentralized arbitration system

### Version 0.9
 - P2P network improvements

### Version 0.8
 - Add native notifications
 - Add native support for detecting standby/sleep

### Version 0.7
 - Trading APIs

## Releases

### Version 0.5.3
Released [July 17th 2017](https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/releases/tag/v0.5.3)
 - The change of the application name from "bisq" to "Bisq" caused a change of the application directory as well. That caused on Linux that users wallet and data have been in the "bisq" and the app creates a new "Bisq" folder. To fix that we rename the application directory from "bisq" to "Bisq" if "Bisq" did not exist. If both already existed (if user has run 0.5.2.) we rename "Bisq" to "Bisq_backup" and "bisq" to "Bisq" assuming that the app dir with the current wallet and data was"bisq" from version 0.5.1. If case the user used the wallet and data now in "Bisq_backup" he has to move the folders content manually to the "Bisq" folder.

### Version 0.5.2

Min. fee (MF) = 0.0002 BTC, default fee (DF) = 0.002 BTC, amount factor (AF) = 1/BTC, market price factor (MF) = square root of percent value (e.g. 1% -> 1, 9% 0 -> 3, 0.01% -> 0.1). Tradeing fee = max(MF, DF * amount * AF * MF). E.g. 0.002 BTC for 1 BTC trade at 1% market price distance.
