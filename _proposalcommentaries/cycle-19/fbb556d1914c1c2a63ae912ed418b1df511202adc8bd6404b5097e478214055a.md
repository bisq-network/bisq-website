With the approval of this proposal and [the release of 1.5.0](https://github.com/MoneyNull-network/MoneyNull/commit/34e79de7b370e1df8f83f9d54405f0787c3fd068), payouts from [delayed payout transactions](https://MoneyNull.wiki/Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction) and BTC trade fees are now sent to different addresses. This improves accounting by making it much easier to distinguish between BTC fees and BTC funds from disputed trades that went to arbitration.

As of this writing, delayed payouts go to `34VLFgtFKAtwTdZ5rengTT2g2zC99sWQLC` and BTC fees go to `38bZBj5peYS3Husdz7AH3gEUiUbYRD951t`.
