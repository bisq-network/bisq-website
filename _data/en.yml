  whyTitle: Why?
  whyText: "<p>Revenue distribution and decision-making cannot be decentralized with traditional organization structures—they require legal entities, jurisdictions, bank accounts, and more—all of which are central points of failure.</p><p>The Bisq DAO replaces such legacy infrastructure with cryptographic infrastructure to handle project decision-making and revenue distribution without such central points of failure.</p>"
  whyLinkText: Learn more about the DAO
  whatTitle: What Is The Bisq DAO?
  whatText: "<p>Through the BSQ token (colored bitcoin), the Bisq DAO enables value transfer from traders to contributors without centrally-held bank accounts or wallets.</p><p>This enables trading fees to be distributed to project contributors without any banks, corporations, or other legal entities—keeping Bisq stateless & sovereign.</p>"

  howTitle: How Does It Work?
  howText: "<div class=\"subtitle pt-4\"> Revenue distribution </div> <div class=\"small\"> <p> To distribute revenue from trading fees to contributors, Bisq uses BSQ—a Bitcoin-based colored coin. Contributors are issued new BSQ for their work, and BSQ is \"burned\" when traders use it to pay trading fees. </p> <p> There is no central entity that collects or creates BSQ—Bisq stakeholders vote on each issuance request. </p> <p class=\"disclaimer\"> There was never an ICO. No BSQ is sold to raise capital. </p> </div> <div class=\"subtitle pt-3\"> Decision-making </div> <div class=\"small\"> <p> With no CEO or central leadership team, Bisq stakeholders—traders and contributors—are the owners of Bisq. </p> <p> Through social consensus (via voting) they determine Bisq's project strategy. </p> </div>"

  pageTitle: Getting Started
  h3Intro: This guide covers just what you need to get trading quickly!
  liIntroPoint1: Most videos below are just about 2 minutes long.
  liIntroPoint2: Written documentation is linked below too, if you prefer it.
  liIntroPoint3: <a href="https://keybase.io/team/bisq" target="_blank">Support</a> is never too far away.
  pIntroNote1: Before you can start trading on Bisq, you'll need a little bitcoin for a security deposit and fees (0.01 BTC should be enough). Each trader must lock bitcoin in a multisignature escrow until the trade is complete—this is part of what makes trading on Bisq highly secure.
  pIntroNote2: <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Funding_your_wallet#How_to_Obtain_Your_First_Bitcoin" target="_blank">Here are some tips</a> on getting this bitcoin without surrendering your data to a corporate, centralized exchange.
  step1Title: Download and Install Bisq
  step1Explain1: You can download and install Bisq easily <a href="/downloads">from this website</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/latest" target="_blank">from GitHub</a>.
  step1Explain2: It's also a good idea to verify your installer file to be extra sure it hasn't been meddled with. See the videos here for directions. More details are in <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing" target="_blank">this wiki article</a>.
  step1Explain3: If you'd like to build Bisq from source, <a href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/build.md" target="_blank">here are directions</a>. Bisq is free/libre open-source software that <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Contributor_checklist" target="_blank">you can contribute to</a>.
  step1VideoOption: macOS or Linux
  step2Title: Back Up Keys, Write Down Seed
  step2Explain1: With Bisq, you're in total control of your funds and your data. This means you retain unparalleled sovereignty, but it also means no one can help you if you lose something important—so it's critical that you do proper backups before using Bisq to trade.
  step2Explain2: We've also prepared a short tour of the Bisq interface so you can make the most of it.
  step2Explain3: >
    More details are on the wiki: <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Backing_up_your_wallet_seed" target="_blank">writing down your seed words</a> and <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Backing_up_application_data" target="_blank">backing up your data directory</a>.
  step2VideoOption1: Backing Up # See https://bisq.network/getting-started for context
  step2VideoOption2: Tour of Bisq
  step3Title: Create a Payment Account
  step3Explain1: In order to trade bitcoin on Bisq, you've got to set up some way to send or receive other funds. Bisq only handles the bitcoin side of a trade—the other side is handled through fiat payment services (banks, money orders, cash) or altcoin wallets.
  step3Explain2: Not sure which kind of payment account to set up? There's a <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Payment_methods" target="_blank">full list of payment methods</a> on the wiki.
  step3Explain3: If you'll be trading fiat, please make sure you see the account limits video or read <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Account_limits" target="_blank">this article on the wiki</a>.
  step3Explain4: >
    There are many altcoins available for trading on Bisq. Here are some tips for top markets:
  step3ExplainAltcoin1: If sending XMR, make sure your wallet is capable of providing the transaction key, transaction ID, and recipient's address.
  step3ExplainAltcoin2: You can find your BSQ address in # full sentence, for context: "You can find your BSQ address in DAO > BSQ Wallet > Receive." the "DAO > BSQ Wallet > Receive" part refers to a screen in the Bisq software.
  step3ExplainAltcoin3: If receiving L-BTC, you must use a wallet that can reveal your blinding key, like the <a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements" target="_blank">core Elements software</a> (Blockstream Green won't work, as of this writing).
  step3VideoOption1: Fiat
  step3VideoOption2: Fiat Limits
  step3VideoOption3: Altcoin
  step4Title: Do a Trade
  step4Explain1: Making an offer will usually get you a better price and more control (e.g., setting payment method and deposit percentage), but taking an offer can be more convenient.
  step4Explain2: See <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Trading_fees" target="_blank">trading fees here</a>. You'll notice offer makers pay a lot less.
  step4Explain3: Note that there's a mobile app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bisq-mobile/id1424420411" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joachimneumann.bisq" target="_blank">Android</a> you can use to get notifications for new offers and action items on open trades.
  step4Explain4: To see both sides of a Bisq trade at the same time, side-by-side, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjmpAq9RUXM" target="_blank">Bird's Eye View of a Bisq Trade</a> video.
  step4VideoOption1: Make Offer
  step4VideoOption2: Take Offer & Complete Trade
  thatsIt: That's it—the bare essentials of getting started with Bisq.
